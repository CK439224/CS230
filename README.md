•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
o	The client for this project was “The Gaming Room” and they wanted us at “Creative Technology Solutions” to consult on project. The client wanted to expand their current game “Draw It or Lose It” that is currently only available on Android to a web-based game that can be utilized by multiple platforms. The client provided a set of requirements that needed to be met such as: A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved, Each team will have multiple players assigned to it, Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name, and Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
o	I feel as though I did pretty good at understanding and expressing what the client wanted. I found it pretty easy to convey the information that was needed.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
o	Different sections in the software design document were helpful when developing the code, but the one I found quite useful was the UML diagram, not only did it help identify the different classes, but it also helped me visualize what I was creating. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
o	I would choose the evaluation section. I struggled a little bit trying to get my thoughts across and feel that I could have structured it better than I did.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
o	I think the best way to interpret the user’s needs is to visualize it as if you are the user. If you put them in their shoes and just think about how you can make it easier to use and how you feel that the design should be. I would also take into account the audience that the software would be used for. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
o	I essentially took it step by step and kept referring back to the clients requirements and goal and ensured that I was meeting those expectations as I was designing the software.
